    "type": "drive-by",
    "description": "CAP is trying to avoid hardwired lock-ins through higher-level concepts and APIs, but the out-of-the-box support is heavily focussing on SAP's own tools and technologies. So in terms of databases, SAP HANA currently is the only out-of-the-box supported database for running CAP apps in production scenarios. \nDue to the modular concepts, CAP offers an abstraction layer for database adapters. By using this layer, it is possible to add support for other relational and even non-relational databases. But since there is no out-of-the-box solution provided by SAP, those database adapters need to be implemented by others.\nIn this talk I will give an overview of the current state of the database abstraction layer (from a non CAP core developer perspective) and present the Open Source PostgresSQL adapter (cds-pg) implemented by members of the SAP Community. I will also give some insights into the development process, which may help you to either implement your own CAP database adapter or to participate in the further development of cds-pg.",
